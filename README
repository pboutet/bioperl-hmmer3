This is the README file for the BioPerl HMMER v3 distribution

This bioperl extension handles operations pertinent to HMMER v3. In its current implementation, 
this module implements Bio::SearchIO based methods to parse hmmsearch and hmmscan outputs. Future
endeavors should include extending these methods to handle additional output formats and various
Bio::Run based wrappers for execution of HMMER v3 software.

Implementation of this code requries the code BioPerl library (bioperl-live), which you may obtain here:
http://github.com/bioperl/bioperl-live

This is community generated software. Please contact the BioPerl mailing list with specific questions:
bioperl-l@bioperl.org
